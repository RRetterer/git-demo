  I hope this email finds you doing well and life is good.  I am responding to your inquiry regarding confluent-Kafka.  As Jorn
pointed out to you before, the only package that VSI provides at this point in time, is LIBRDKAFKA V1.8.2 from Apache.org. 
Confluent-Kafka, builds on the Apache Release of Kafka, but provides a few more user-friendly features.
