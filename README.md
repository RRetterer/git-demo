  I hope this email finds you doing well and life is good.  I am responding to your inquiry regarding confluent-Kafka.  As Jorn
pointed out to you before, the only package that VSI provides at this point in time, is LIBRDKAFKA V1.8.2 from Apache.org. 
Confluent-Kafka, builds on the Apache Release of Kafka, but provides a few more user-friendly features.

Apache Kafka:
	A free, open-source distributed streaming platform. 
	Used for building real-time applications and streaming data pipelines.
	Can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud.
	Requires management and maintenance of the Kafka infrastructure. 

Confluent Kafka:
	A commercial platform that builds upon Apache Kafka. 
	Offers a variety of services, including: 
o	Confluent Cloud: A fully managed, cloud-native Kafka service. 
o	Confluent Platform: An on-premises, self-managed platform. 

	Provides features like:
o	Easier data integration: With Connect, Schema Registry, and ksqlDB. 
o	Managed infrastructure: For easier deployment, scaling, and monitoring. 
o	Enterprise-grade security and governance: For protecting sensitive data.

	Offers both free and paid features. 

In essence, Confluent provides a more complete and easier-to-use solution for organizations looking to deploy and manage Kafka
deployments, whether in the cloud or on-premises.
